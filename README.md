# daPulse chat app
In order to run the app do the following:
1.Make sure you have mongoDB installed and running (use `$ mongod`)

2.In the main project folder run `$ npm install && bower install`

3.Run the server via `$ grunt prod` and open your browser at `http://localhost:8443/`


### Notes
This app is a scaffold of the `meanJS` app hence it includes some unused modules.
Do note that _I did not use_ Socket.io even-though it is installed
 (was required by meanJS and I didn't remove the dependency)
 
 
 
### Have a great day, Aviad.
